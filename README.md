### by Kristina Thabet // Fall 2021 // Dr. Sookie Cho // 10.18.2021
## Introductory Steps

### Step 1: Specify the main design challenge

**What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?**
>This project will support users in being able to navigate the New York DMV website in order to obtain a license. It will also support users in having a better understanding of the functionality of the website as a whole. 

**What is the basic need involved for that activity?**
>This activity fulfills the users safety and esteem needs. If users are going to be operating a vehicle, it is important that they have a drivers license to prove that they are equipt to drive and aware of the rules on the road. This is not only for the saftely of themselves, but for the safely of all drivers in the area. This activity also fulfills the users basic need for self esteem because having a drivers license allows you to travel alone, giving users a sense of freedom and individualism. 

**What is/are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**
>It is manditory that you go through the DMV in order to get a license. Many people watch YouTube videos about the process of obtaining a license if they feel like the DMV website is too overwhelming. Other individuals choose to go to the DMV directly and speak with a representative there. There are also many external websites that lay of the steps to gettng a license. 

**What is/are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital)
technology?**
>Certain limitations to obtaining a license that can be improved with digital technology is not having to wait at the DMV and having easy access to all documentation necessary to complete paperwork needed for a license. Individuals who attend the DMV without all their paperwork are turned away and forced to wait again for another appointment. Digital Technology allows users to have all the information about the DMV in one place that is easily accessible at all times. 


### Step 2: Identify target users

**What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)** 
>Demographic: Teenagers, Young Adults, Car owners, travelers

>Preferences: Users who prefer having their own transportation rather than using public transport. Users who travel a lot and need a license to operate a vehicle. 

>Expertise: Users do not need any particular level of expertise to use this application.

**In which context (where, why) would the users do that activity?** 
>The New York State DMV Website is where New York drivers can recieve information, steps, and appointments to renew, replace, make changes to, or get a license. Users can find information of the neccessary paperwork they need in order to bring it into the DMV and obtain a license. Users would do this activity, usially in the comfort of their home or workplace, in order to a safe and registered driver in the state of New York. This website serves the public by licensing drivers, securing identities, and regualting the vehicle industry.

**What do/did the users usually do in order to complete that activity?** 
>There is no other way to obtain a New York drivers license if users do not go through the New York  DMV. When it comes to finding outside resources that lay out the steps to obtaining a license, users can turn to YouTube, external websites, or blogs. 

### Step 3: Pick observation method(s)
**The two observation methods I employed are ethnographic research and participatory observation.** 

My ethnographic research consists of monitoring how my interviewee searches for information about obtaining a license for themselves, prior to me giving them any informaton about the DMV website. My interviewee plans to move to New York after graduation this year, hoping to be a licensed driver there. Some of my observations include:

> Individuals tend to google "How to get a License" instead of googling the DMV website. 

> The interviewee was stressed even before searching for information, proving that getting a license is understood to be a stressful experience.  

> Individuals tend to look for an online appointment to recieve a license rather than reading the necessary steps first. 
 
> YouTube was the interviewees last option when she began getting frustrated trying to find information.

> The interviewee googled "How to switch a California license to a New York license," probably thinking this, if it existed, would be the easiest option.  

> The interviewee got frusterated and shut her laptop once she cound not find an appointmeent at the DMV.


I am conductiong this participatory research with a friend who fits my target demographic and plans to obtain a New York driver license in the near future.

### Reflection
The overall experience of creating and conducting this interview was much smoother than last weeks pilot UT. Since this activity was less focused on specific tasks and more focused on the general needs the app fullfills, it was much less stressful on the user. I realized that it is crucial to make your participant as comfortable as possible during the activity so they feel like they can say the truth about their experiences. Since I interviewed a friend of mine, it was easy for me to feel like she is being honest in her responses. Allowing the participant to engage with the app without instruction provides very important information about which parts of the app are most compelling to users. I was able to take note of many features on the app based on the order in which the particpant engaged with it's tabs. Without instruction, the participant was able to navigate to the "Getting a License" Info page, proving that the app is intuitive and easy to use. If I were to conduct this activity again in the future, I would make sure I have a participant that is very vocal about her thoughts and emotions. My participant was quite shy and this resulted in a less detailed activity.
